<br/>
<br/>

## Intro in details.
* #### git_push.sh
    I cannot remember commands of git, so I write down these into this script.
    <br/>
    but fuck, it cannot work.
* #### color_h2d.sh
    convert color from hex format to dec format.
    <br/>
    it's for every MS-Office-like software which I cannot find the hex color in.
